---I built a movie recommendation chatbot that helps users find films they might like. First, I cleaned and organized the movie data to make sure it was accurate and easy to work with. Then, I created a system that compares movie descriptions to suggest similar titles based on what the user likes. I used a simple web chatbot so users can get real-time suggestions by just typing a message. I also analyzed and visualized movie trends to better understand whatâ€™s popular, and designed the chat interface to be clean and easy to use.
